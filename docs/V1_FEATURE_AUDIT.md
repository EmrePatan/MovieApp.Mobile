# MovieApp V1 Feature Audit

**Date:** September 2026  
**Scope:** Backend (`MovieApp`) + Mobile (`MovieApp.Mobile`)  
**Purpose:** Determine what must be implemented before the first public commercial release.  
**Status:** Audit / planning only — no implementation in this step.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

MovieApp is a **movie and TV tracking application** with a mature feature set: authentication, personalized home, search, discovery, detail pages, favorites, watchlists, ratings, reviews, watch history with TV progress, recommendations, profile management, account deletion, a mobile design system, and EAS production configuration scaffolding.

**The product is closer to launch-ready than a typical greenfield app**, but several gaps would block a credible public release:

| Category | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Core tracking flows** | Largely complete on backend and mobile |
| **Production catalog quality** | **Blocker:** TV catalog uses a Fake provider only; movies can use TMDB |
| **Account recovery** | **Blocker:** No forgot-password / email reset flow |
| **Store / legal compliance** | **Blocker:** Privacy policy URL, support contact, store assets, production API URL not in repo |
| **Operational readiness** | **Blocker:** No rate limiting, no crash/error monitoring, no production analytics baseline |
| **Deferred roadmap items** | Mostly correctly deferrable (social, notifications, Elasticsearch, monetization, where-to-watch) |

**Recommended V1 posture:** Ship a focused **authenticated tracking app** with real TMDB-backed catalog data (movies + TV), password recovery, basic operational monitoring, store compliance artifacts, and a small set of mobile UX gaps (favorites list, advanced search UI, continue-watching polish). Do **not** attempt to implement the full deferred roadmap before launch.

**Bottom line:** ~85% of core product functionality exists. The remaining ~15% is concentrated in **production infrastructure, account security/recovery, real TV catalog ingestion, store compliance, and a handful of mobile UX completeness items**.

## 3. V1 Required Features

Features the app **should not go public without**.

### 3.1 Production backend deployment + HTTPS API URL

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Backend runs locally; mobile production URL is a placeholder in `.env.example`; EAS env var required |
| **Classification** | 🟢 V1 REQUIRED |
| **Why** | Mobile production builds reject localhost/LAN; stores require a working production backend |
| **User/business value** | App functions for real users |
| **Backend impact** | Deploy API, PostgreSQL, Redis; configure JWT signing key, TMDB key, CORS |
| **Mobile impact** | Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in EAS production env |
| **Dependencies** | Hosting, TLS certificate, database migration strategy |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Store importance** | Critical |
| **Risks if postponed** | Cannot ship |
| **Recommendation** | Deploy backend first; validate with preview EAS builds before store submission |

### 3.2 Real TV catalog ingestion (TMDB TV)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Backend-only Fake TV provider; movies can use TMDB |
| **Classification** | 🟢 V1 REQUIRED |
| **Why** | A public movie/TV app cannot ship with synthetic TV catalog data |
| **User/business value** | Trust, discoverability, accurate metadata |
| **Backend impact** | Implement TMDB TV provider (or TVDB); lazy upsert like movies |
| **Mobile impact** | None if API contracts unchanged |
| **Dependencies** | TMDB API key, provider abstraction already exists |
| **Complexity** | High |
| **Store importance** | Critical (product credibility) |
| **Risks if postponed** | App Store / Play rejection risk; user churn |
| **Recommendation** | Priority backend work before public launch |

### 3.3 Password reset (forgot password)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Completely missing; authenticated password change only |
| **Classification** | 🟢 V1 REQUIRED |
| **Why** | Standard consumer expectation; store reviewers and users expect account recovery |
| **User/business value** | Account recovery without support tickets |
| **Backend impact** | Reset token entity, email sender, `POST /forgot-password`, `POST /reset-password` |
| **Mobile impact** | Forgot-password screen + deep link or token entry |
| **Dependencies** | Email delivery (SMTP/SendGrid/etc.) |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Store importance** | High |
| **Risks if postponed** | Support burden, bad reviews, perceived insecurity |
| **Recommendation** | Implement minimal email-link reset flow |

### 3.4 Auth endpoint rate limiting

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Documented as future work; no middleware |
| **Classification** | 🟢 V1 REQUIRED |
| **Why** | Public login/register endpoints are abuse vectors without throttling |
| **User/business value** | Protects service availability |
| **Backend impact** | ASP.NET rate limiter on auth routes |
| **Mobile impact** | Handle 429 responses gracefully |
| **Dependencies** | None |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Store importance** | Medium (security posture) |
| **Risks if postponed** | Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, API cost spikes |
| **Recommendation** | Add per-IP limits on register/login before public launch |

### 3.5 Privacy policy URL + support contact

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Not in repo (correct — legal text should not be invented here) |
| **Classification** | 🟢 V1 REQUIRED |
| **Why** | Mandatory for Google Play and App Store |
| **User/business value** | Legal compliance, user trust |
| **Backend impact** | Optional hosted page or external URL |
| **Mobile impact** | Link from profile/settings; App Store Connect / Play Console fields |
| **Dependencies** | Legal review, hosted webpage |
| **Complexity** | Low (non-engineering) |
| **Store importance** | Critical |
| **Risks if postponed** | Store submission blocked |
| **Recommendation** | Prepare externally; add in-app link only after URL exists |

### 3.6 Store signing credentials + listing assets

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | EAS profiles ready; credentials and screenshots TODO |
| **Classification** | 🟢 V1 REQUIRED |
| **Why** | Cannot submit without signing and store metadata |
| **Backend impact** | None |
| **Mobile impact** | `eas credentials`, screenshots, descriptions |
| **Dependencies** | Apple Developer + Google Play accounts |
| **Complexity** | Medium (operational) |
| **Store importance** | Critical |
| **Risks if postponed** | Cannot publish |
| **Recommendation** | Follow `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` |

### 3.7 Image base URL for production posters

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Optional `EXPO_PUBLIC_IMAGE_BASE_URL`; placeholders without it |
| **Classification** | 🟢 V1 REQUIRED |
| **Why** | Poster-less catalog UI is not shippable quality |
| **User/business value** | Visual discovery and recognition |
| **Backend impact** | May need CDN or TMDB image base documented |
| **Mobile impact** | Set EAS env var |
| **Dependencies** | Image hosting strategy (TMDB CDN URLs or backend proxy) |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Store importance** | High (store screenshots depend on it) |
| **Risks if postponed** | Poor UX, low store conversion |
| **Recommendation** | Configure before marketing screenshots |

### 3.8 Favorites list screen (mobile)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|-------|
| **Current status** | Partial — toggle on detail pages; backend list API exists |
| **Classification** | 🟢 V1 REQUIRED |
| **Why** | Core library feature incomplete without browse/manage view |
| **User/business value** | Users expect to see saved titles |
| **Backend impact** | None (API exists) |
| **Mobile impact** | New screen + profile navigation link |
| **Dependencies** | None |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Store importance** | Medium |
| **Risks if postponed** | Feature feels broken; inefficient status resolution workaround |
| **Recommendation** | Add paginated favorites screen using existing API |

---

## 4. V1 Recommended Features

Strongly improve the initial product; can technically launch without, but should be planned immediately after required items.

### 4.1 Email verification

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Missing |
| **Classification** | 🟡 V1 RECOMMENDED |
| **Why** | Reduces spam accounts and invalid emails; not always enforced at V1 |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Recommendation** | Implement if abuse appears in beta; defer only with monitoring |

### 4.2 Crash / error monitoring

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Missing (no Sentry/Crashlytics/etc.) |
| **Classification** | 🟡 V1 RECOMMENDED |
| **Why** | Blind to production failures without it |
| **Complexity** | Low–Medium |
| **Recommendation** | Add before wide release; acceptable for closed beta without |

### 4.3 Basic product analytics

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Missing |
| **Classification** | 🟡 V1 RECOMMENDED |
| **Why** | Need funnel/retention data post-launch; not a user-facing feature |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Recommendation** | Minimal event set: register, login, favorite, rate, review, watch mark |

### 4.4 Advanced search filter UI (mobile)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Backend supports genre/year/rating/sort; mobile has type filter only |
| **Classification** | 🟡 V1 RECOMMENDED |
| **Why** | Differentiator for discovery; basic search still works |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Recommendation** | Ship V1 with basic search if timeline tight; add filters in first update |

### 4.5 Continue watching UX polish

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Home section renders generic cards; no next-episode/progress indicator |
| **Classification** | 🟡 V1 RECOMMENDED |

| **Complexity** | Low (mobile UI only) |
| **Recommendation** | Add next-episode label and progress chip on home cards |

### 4.6 Session expiry UX (JWT re-login)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | 60-min JWT, no refresh tokens; 401 clears session |
| **Classification** | 🟡 V1 RECOMMENDED |
| **Why** | Usable but abrupt; refresh tokens are larger scope |
| **Complexity** | Low (friendly message) to High (refresh tokens) |
| **Recommendation** | V1: clear "session expired" messaging; V1.1: refresh tokens |

### 4.7 Cast/crew ingestion from TMDB

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Schema exists; genres synced; cast not populated |
| **Classification** | 🟡 V1 RECOMMENDED |
| **Why** | Degrades recommendation quality and detail richness |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Recommendation** | Populate during movie/TV upsert |

### 4.8 Catalog freshness policy

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | On-demand upsert only; stale DB reads with no re-sync |

| **Why** | Metadata can become outdated |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Recommendation** | Re-fetch if `UpdatedAt` older than N days on detail read |

### 4.9 Lightweight onboarding

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Current status** | Missing — straight to login/home |
| **Classification** | 🟡 V1 RECOMMENDED |
| **Why** | Helps first-time users understand tracking value |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Recommendation** | 2–3 screen carousel; skip allowed |

### 4.10 Network offline banner

## 6. Not Needed Now

Do not implement before V1 unless a concrete business or compliance reason emerges.

| Feature | Current Status | Classification | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Elasticsearch** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | PostgreSQL search adequate for launch scale |
| **Social feed / following** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | Personal tracker, not social network |
| **Push notifications** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | No notification-worthy events in V1 product |
| **Review likes/replies/reporting** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | Adds moderation burden without V1 need |
| **Episode/season ratings** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | Show-level ratings cover primary use case |
| **Where to Watch** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | Different product surface; TMDB licensing separate |
| **Playback position** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | No video player; tracking ≠ streaming |
| **Monetization / ads / premium** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | No revenue model defined |
| **Onboarding (elaborate)** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | Simple optional carousel sufficient if any |
| **Advanced search (if basic ships)** | Backend ready | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | Only if basic search deemed enough for day one |
| **Analytics (if crash monitoring only)** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | Crash monitoring higher priority than funnels |
| **TVDB provider** | Config stub only | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | TMDB TV likely sufficient first |
| **Collaborative filtering / ML recommendations** | Rule-based v1 | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | Current engine is adequate foundation |
| **Certificate pinning** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | HTTPS + standard TLS sufficient for V1 |
| **Biometric login** | Not implemented | 🔴 NOT NEEDED NOW | Convenience feature |

## 7. Production / Store Blockers

### True blockers (must resolve before public release)

| # | Blocker | Owner | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Production HTTPS API deployed | Backend/DevOps | Set EAS `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` |
| 2 | TMDB TV catalog (replace Fake provider) | Backend | Fake data unacceptable publicly |
| 3 | Password reset flow | Backend + Mobile | Account recovery |
| 4 | Auth rate limiting | Backend | Brute-force protection |
| 5 | Privacy policy URL | Legal/Ops | Store mandatory |
| 6 | Support email/URL | Ops | Store mandatory |

| Refresh tokens | Re-login acceptable with good UX |
| Email verification | Recommended, not always required day one |
| Notifications | No product feature depends on push |
| Social features | Out of scope for tracking V1 |
| Universal links | Custom scheme works for V1 |
| Offline mode | Network-required app is acceptable |
| Analytics SDK | Recommended but not submission-blocking |
| Onboarding | Optional polish |

## 11. Dependency Map

```
Production HTTPS API URL
  → requires Backend deployment (PostgreSQL, Redis, JWT, TMDB key)
  → requires Mobile EAS env (EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL, EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production)
  → requires TLS + CORS

TMDB TV catalog
  → requires Backend TMDB TV provider (ITvShowDataProvider implementation)
  → requires TMDB API key + terms compliance
  → enables Mobile TV detail/season/episode (no contract change)

Password reset
  → requires Backend email sender + reset token storage + 2 endpoints
  → requires Mobile forgot-password + reset screens
  → depends on Email delivery service (SendGrid/SMTP)

Auth rate limiting
  → requires Backend middleware only
  → optionally Mobile 429 error handling

Favorites list screen
  → requires Mobile UI only
  → uses existing GET /api/favorites

Advanced search filters
  → requires Mobile UI (genre picker, year, rating range, sort)
  → uses existing GET /api/search parameters
  → optionally Backend genre list endpoint (genres in search results today)

Continue watching polish
  → requires Mobile home card UI
  → uses existing Home API ContinueWatching section (TV progress data)

Crash monitoring
  → requires Mobile SDK (e.g., Sentry)
  → optionally Backend error tracking

Privacy policy / support URL
  → requires Legal/Ops hosted pages
  → requires Mobile profile links

Store submission
  → requires EAS credentials
  → requires screenshots (need image base URL working)
  → requires privacy/support URLs
  → requires production API live

Where to Watch (deferred)
  → would require Backend provider integration (TMDB watch/providers)
  → would require Mobile availability UI
  → would require licensing review

Refresh tokens (deferred)
  → would require Backend token store + rotation
  → would require Mobile silent refresh logic
  → would change auth architecture

Elasticsearch (deferred)
  → would replace ISearchRepository implementation
  → no Mobile impact
```
